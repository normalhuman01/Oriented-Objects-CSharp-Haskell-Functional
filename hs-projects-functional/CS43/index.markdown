## Online Lectures (Week 10)

As per university guidelines, we are making Week 10 lectures available online as blog posts.

- [Lecture 19, Parallel Programming](notes/L19_Parallel_Programming.html)

- [Lecture 20, coming soon.]

## General Info

This course covers the fundamentals of functional programming and algebraic type
systems, and explores a selection of modern programming paradigms and current
research in these areas. [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is taught and used
throughout the course, though much of the material is applicable to other
languages.  Topics will be covered from both theoretical and practical points of
view, and will include higher order functions, immutable data structures,
algebraic data types, type inference, lenses and optics, effect systems,
concurrency and parallelism, and dependent types.

- Instructors: Isaac Scheinfeld, Adithya Ganesh, Patrick DeMichele
- Advisor: Jerry Cain
- Time: Tue / Thu: 4:30pm - 5:50pm, usually ending 5:30 for questions
- Location: Building 200, Room 030
- Office Hours: Tue / Wed 1:30pm - 2:30pm, Old Union first floor couches

## Why Haskell?

Haskell is a pure, lazy language with strong typing. We think this 
combination of features makes it one of the most elegant programming
languages in existence, giving it great expressive power and making it very easy
to write and refactor code that does what you think it does. But you'll have to
take the class for us to convince you of this!

Haskell is also a production-ready research language. It presents a unique
combination of actual industry usage[^USE]  and constant evolution.  Many old concepts
from Haskell have been incorporated into other languages[^FEATS] and many new ideas
in programming language theory are being worked out in Haskell today.

[^USE]: See Github's
  [Semantic](https://github.com/github/semantic), Facebook's
  [Sigma](https://engineering.fb.com/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/), and
  the [Elm](https://github.com/elm/compiler/tree/master/compiler/src/Elm)
  compiler.

[^FEATS]: Examples include list comprehensions in Python, traits in Rust, and optionals in Swift.

## Resources

There is no formal textbook. [Lecture code](/notes.html) will be released as
material is covered in class. A list of resources can be found
[here](/resources.html), and will be updated with additional material as the
class progresses. We recommend the [Haskell
wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell) and [Learn You a
Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) as primary free references.

## Assignments

Assignments will be posted here. They will generally be biweekly, and the intent
is to provide sufficient starter code to make developing interesting software
possible. 

- [Assignment 1](/assignments/assign1.html) Out Jan 9 / Due Jan 23.
- [Assignment 2](/assignments/assign2.html) Out Jan 28 / Due Feb 6.
- [Assignment 3](/assignments/assign3.html) Out Feb 10 / Due Feb 20.
- [Assignment 4](/assignments/assign4.html) Out Feb 29 / Due Mar 13.

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites, but we recommend "programming and
mathematical maturity."  In terms of Stanford courses, CS107 + CS103 or
equivalent experience will suffice, though the material in those courses 
will not be heavily relied upon.

This course intends to cover a lot of material, and depending on background some
topics may be more easily accessible than others. However, the aim is to provide
enough background in class for everyone to master the basics of Haskell, and
enough flexibility for people to focus on more theoretical or applied problems
depending on personal interest.

## Expectations

To pass the class (graded C/NC), we expect:

1. Attendance in $\ge$ 80% of lectures. There will be in-class exercises to
   attempt before working them out as a class, so students should bring a laptop.
2. Successful completion of the assignments. Submission deadlines will not be
   enforced but all work must be completed by the end of the quarter. Solutions
   will be available upon submission.

## Accessibility

We as a course staff are dedicated to making this course accessible to everyone.
Please let us know if you have any OAE accommodations or if we can do anything
to make the course materials and presentation more accessible. Also, feel free
to reach out with any personal questions or concerns about the course. We are always open
to making changes!
