title: Resources
---

This is a selection of resources that we have found useful to enlightening.
Rather than being arranged by media type (books, videos, research papers, blog
posts, etc.) they are (will be) arranged by topic. 

## The go-tos

[Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/): The Haskell search engine. Search for
everything from functions to type-signatures.

[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/): The Haskell package repository. Reading
docs and source code is the best way to learn how real Haskell code is written.
Hackage has a lot of "noise" packages, but those with a wide userbase are
usually well documented.

## The must-reads (at some point)

Stephen Diehl's [What I Wish I Knew When Learning
Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/): A classic compilation of succinct
descriptions of countless Haskell tools, idioms, typeclasses, libraries, and
advanced features. Note especially the section on GHC's language extensions.
