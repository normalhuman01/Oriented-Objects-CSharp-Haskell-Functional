title: Assignment 5

## Problem

This week's homework is to complete an implementation of Harold the Robot.
The starter code can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/stanford-lambda/stanford-lambda.gitlab.io/tree/master/starter-code/assignment5).
Note that since some additional configuration is required to enable the packages
used, you should clone the `harold` folder directly rather than just the source
code in `src`.

The homework is simply to complete the functions which are marked incomplete in
the starter code. Modifications should be made to `Harold.hs` and `Main.hs`, while `World.hs` 
provides the types and functions required to create the World that Harold lives in.
`Main.hs` can be run either by running `main` in ghci or by building and
executing the project. After implementing the required functions, Harold should
place a beeper (represented by an `x`) at each corner of his world.

As with the last assignment, this is meant primarily as an exercise in reading and
understanding Haskell. The code that needs to be written is quite short.
