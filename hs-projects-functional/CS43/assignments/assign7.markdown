title: Assignment 7
---

## Problem

As this assignment is optional for most, I have decided to make it both more
flexible and less guided than the previous assignments. You have three options
to choose from.

1. Pick a Haskell library you think is cool and write a small program using it.
   Some recommendations to check out are 
   
   - `diagrams`
   - `scotty`
   - `aeson`
   - `reflex`
   - `brick`
   - `quickcheck`

1. Pick (from the list below) a chapter from the advanced track of the [Haskell Wiki
   Book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell) 
   or one of the articles linked and write a small program based on its
   topic. It can be an extension of code given in the chapter, or of your own
   design.

   - Foldable
   - Traversable
   - Arrows
   - Continuation passing style
   - Zippers
   - Lenses
   - Mutable objects
   - [Higher-Kinded Data](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data/)
   - [Freer Monads](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/freer-monads/)
   - [Probability Monad](https://jtobin.io/giry-monad-implementation)
     

1. Pick a *primarily* functional programming language other than Haskell and write a small
   but non-trivial (up to your own interpretation) program in it. Some examples
   of languages include

   - Scheme / Common Lisp / Racket / Clojure
   - OCaml
   - Erlang
   - Scala
   - F#
