# Level 06

In this exercise we will expand the capabilities of our `AppM` transformer, and
use that to build some configuration capabilities into our application.

This exercise will require a combination of building the right types to guide
your development, plus consulting plenty of documentation to leverage the chosen
packages. There may also be, depending on your level of interest, some external
reading for later as well.

The steps for this level:
1) ``src/Level06/AppM.hs``
2) ``src/Level06/Types.hs``
3) ``src/Level06/Conf/File.hs``
4) ``src/Level06/Conf.hs``
5) ``src/Level06/Core.hs``

The packages we will use for this are:

- [Waargonaut](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/waargonaut)
- [Optparse Applicative](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative)
