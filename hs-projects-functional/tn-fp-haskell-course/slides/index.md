Here is the list of lessons:

1. [Introduction](course-01.md)
1. [Types](course-02.md)
1. [Functions](course-03.md)
1. [Polymorphism, typeclasses](course-04.md)

And the list of TPs (_travaux pratiques_):

1. [Boolean, lists](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course/blob/main/tps/TP1.hs)
1. [Card game Ã  la Magic](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course/blob/main/tps/TP2.hs), if you don't like it, do the next one instead.
1. [URL filtering](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course/blob/main/tps/TP3.hs)
1. [Arithmetic evaluator, tested against python3](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course/blob/main/tps/TP4.hs)
1. [Consuming GitHub API, display data in web server](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course/blob/main/tps/TP5.hs)

This course is part of module _Architecture Logicielle_. It will be evaluated
within this module: a subset of the evaluation will be dedicated to Functional
Programming. Evaluation will either concern the lessons above or ask
to write code akin to the content of the _TPs_.

This course is on GitHub: [smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course](https://github.com/smelc/tn-fp-haskell-course).
Please suggest improvements and fix typos by doing [merge requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
You can also do the _TPs_ on your own (since there will be no official time for that)
and create merge requests against the repository, to have me correct your work.
